#Read this before run the project

This is just an example showing how to use authentication and realtime databse from firebase

- If you want to test this example on a emulator you need to have the Google Play Services installed. I used genymotion and this [link](https://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/how-to-install-google-services-on-genymotion/en) show how can you install it

- The project in this repository does not have the *google-services.json* file required for firebase to work. Create a firebase account if you don't have one and read this [link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) to understand how to add firebase to the app.

- The package name that I used for this project is **com.example.vinicius.firebaseteste** but feel free to change if you want different one
